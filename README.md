Converter Project
Overview
This project is a simple converter built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to convert between various units (e.g., length, temperature, or currency) in an intuitive interface.

Features
Conversion between multiple units (e.g., meters to feet, Celsius to Fahrenheit).
Responsive design that works across all devices.
Real-time updates as users input data.
Technologies Used
HTML: Structure of the webpage.
CSS: Styling and layout, ensuring the page is responsive and user-friendly.
JavaScript: Core functionality for performing conversions and updating the UI dynamically.
Challenges Faced
One of the main challenges was handling precision issues during conversions, especially with decimal places. I used JavaScript's built-in toFixed() function to manage the number of decimals in the output.

Installation
No installation required. Simply open the index.html file in a browser to use the converter.

How to Use
Select the units you want to convert from and to.
Enter a value in the input field.
The converted value will be displayed instantly.
